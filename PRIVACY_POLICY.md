# xVault Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how xVault ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles your information when you use our browser extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our extension.

## Information Collection and Use

### Local Storage Only

xVault is designed with privacy as a core principle. The extension:

- **Stores all data locally** on your device using the browser's built-in storage API (chrome.storage)
- **Does not transmit any user data** to external servers or third parties
- **Does not collect any personal information** beyond what you explicitly enter into the extension
- **Does not track your browsing activity** or collect analytics data

### Types of Data Stored Locally

The extension stores the following types of information locally on your device:

1. **Text snippets and notes** that you create and save within the extension
2. **Folder structures** you create to organize your snippets
3. **Extension settings and preferences** you configure
4. **Encrypted data** if you choose to enable password protection

## Security Measures

### Optional Password Protection

xVault offers optional password protection for your snippets. When enabled:

- Your data is encrypted using industry-standard AES-GCM encryption
- Password hashing is performed using PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)
- All cryptographic operations are performed locally on your device
- Your password is never stored or transmitted

### Browser Storage Security

The extension uses the browser's built-in storage mechanisms, which provide isolation between different extensions and websites. This helps protect your data from unauthorized access by other extensions or websites.

## Host Permissions

xVault requires host permissions (*://*.google.com/*) to enable the extension to function on Google websites. This permission is necessary to allow you to access and use your saved text snippets and notes while browsing Google websites. The extension does not collect any data from these websites; it only provides functionality for you to access your locally stored snippets.

## Data Retention and Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- Your data remains on your device until you choose to delete it
- Uninstalling the extension will remove all stored data
- You can export your data at any time for backup purposes
- You can clear all data through the extension's settings

## Children's Privacy

xVault is not directed at individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information to us, please contact us.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the extension's documentation and updating the version information. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
